- [A Nuget package is avalable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Raylib-CsLo)

## What is **Raylib**?
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is a friendly-to-use game framework that includes basic scenarios to meet your needs:  
audio, 2d, 3d, fonts, animation, 2d physics.

Somewhat similar to `Xna` or `MonoGame` but friendlier.  
**However, `Raylib` is a C/CPP framework**.  
`Raylib-CsLo` is a C# Wrapper over the top, which lets you gain raylib's powers to quickly prototype your game ideas.  

## Super easy to use for 2d!
If you stick with 2d, you don't need to use any `unsafe` (pointer) code, which lets 2d users feel at home and use `Raylib-CsLo` as an awesome 2d game framework.

## High performance for 3d! (but `unsafe` to use)
If you use 3d, you need to understand a bit of how pointers work.  
Raylib uses these to link things like `Model`, `Mesh`, and `Material`.  
Writing wrappers over these is possible but it would basically be creating a an entirely new framework.  
I suggest leaving this as-is, as it avoids object allocation (GC Pressure).

Additionally, 3d users: **Be sure you check the Usage Tips section below**, especially on how you need to use
`Matrix4x4.Transpose()` when sending matricies to Raylib.

# How to use/install

## via Nuget
1. add the latest version of [The Raylib-CsLo Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Raylib-CsLo) to your project
2. Create an example project using it, the following code is copied from [The StandAlone Example's Program.cs](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/StandaloneExample/program.cs)
```cs
namespace StandaloneExample;

using Raylib_CsLo;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public static class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Raylib.InitWindow(1280, 720, "Hello, Raylib-CsLo");
        Raylib.SetTargetFPS(60);
        // Main game loop
        while (!Raylib.WindowShouldClose()) // Detect window close button or ESC key
        {
            Raylib.BeginDrawing();
            Raylib.ClearBackground(Raylib.Skyblue);
            Raylib.DrawFPS(10, 10);
            Raylib.DrawText("Raylib is easy!!!", 640, 360, 50, Raylib.Red);
            Raylib.EndDrawing();
        }
        Raylib.CloseWindow();
    }
}
```

## via sources
1. clone/download the [github repository](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo)
2. open `./Raylib-CsLo.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
3. build and run the `Raylib-CsLo.Examples` project will run by default, and will run through all (aprox 100+) examples.
4. For a stand-alone example that uses the Nuget Package, see the [`./StandaloneExample` folder](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/StandaloneExample)

# Linux / OsX / other platform support

The following platforms are shipped in the nuget package:
- `win-x64` : confirmed working on `Win10, x64`. This is the platform used for dev/testing of `raylib-cslo`.
- `linux-x64`: confirmed working on `Arch` Linux. Binaries built under `Ubuntu 20.04` so that shold also work.
- `osx-x64`: not confirmed yet. Please let me know if you try.

You can build the native binaries for whatever platform you need. Please see the readme under [Runtimes/](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo/runtimes) for more info.

# Examples
Here are links to most the examples. The images/links probably won't work from Nuget. [Visit the Github Repo to see it properly.](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo)

# Usage Tips / FAQ
- **How do I do `SOME_IDEA`?**
    - All the Raylib examples (100+) have been ported successfully. Please refer to them here: [ALL 100+ Raylib examples](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo.Examples). If you need more help, ask on Discord.
- **Does `Raylib-CsLo` include the `SOME_FUNCTION_YOU_NEED()` function?**
    - Raylib-CsLo has bindings for everything in the Raylib 4.0 release, including extras like `raygui` and `physac`, but with the exception of things in the `Known Issues` section further below.
- **Why didn't you add a wrapper for function `SOME_OTHER_FUNCTION_YOU_NEED()`?**
    - Raylib-CsLo uses a manual marshalling technique, as the built in PInvoke marshalling is not very efficienct. Most API's have wrappers (and all involving `string` marshalling), but some involving pointers have been left as-is. If you come across a function that you feel needs more wrapping, you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/issues) or perhaps [submit a PR](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/pulls)
- **How do I convert a string to `sbyte*` or vice-versa?**
    - All API's that take `sbyte*` have `string` wrappers, so be sure to look at the overload you can call.
- **Do I have to really cast my Enum to `int`?**
    - The autogen bindings are left untouched, however convenience wrappers are added. Usually these will automagically "work" via function overloads, but where this is not possible, try adding an underscore `_` to the end of the function/property. For example: `Camera3D.projection_ = CameraProjection.CAMERA_ORTHOGRAPHIC;` or `Gesture gesture = Raylib.GetGestureDetected_();`.
    - If all else fails, yes. Cast to `(int)`.
- **I ran the examples in a profiler. What are all these `sbyte[]` arrays being allocated?**
    - A pool of `sbyte[]` is allocated for string marshall purposes, to avoid runtime allocations.
- **Can I, Should I use `RayMath`?**
    - `Raylib_CsLo.RayMath` contains a lot of super helpful functions for doing gamedev related maths.
    - The `RayMath` helper functions have been translated into C# code. This makes the code pretty fast, but if the same function exists under `System.Numerics` you should use that instead, because the DotNet CLR treats things under System.Numerics special, and optimizes it better.
- **Why are my matricies corrupt?**
    - Raylib/OpenGl uses column-major matricies, while dotnet/vulkan/directx uses row-major. When passing your final calculated matrix to raylib for rendering, call `Matrix4x4.Transpose(yourMatrix)`

# Known Issues:
- `RayGui`: be sure to call `RayGui.GuiLoadStyleDefault();` right after you `InitWindow()`. This is needed to initialize the gui properly. If you don't, if you close a raylib window and then open a new one (inside the same app), the gui will be broken.
- The `Text.Unicode` example doesn't render unicode properly. Maybe the required font is missing, maybe there is a bug in the example (Utf16 to Utf8 conversion) or maybe there is a bug in Raylib. A hunch: I think it's probably due to the fonts not including unicode characters, but I didn't investigate further.
- Native Memory allocation functions are not ported: use `System.Runtime.InteropServices.NativeMemory.Alloc()` instead
- `LogCustom()` is ported but doesn't support variable length arguments.
- `Texture2D` doesn't exist. it is just an alias for `Texture` so use that instead. You might want to use `using` aliases like the following

`usings` to make C# code more like the raylib cpp examples.
to see more stuff like this, look at Raylib-CsLo.Examples/program.cs
```cs
global using Camera = Raylib_CsLo.Camera3D;
global using RenderTexture2D = Raylib_CsLo.RenderTexture;
global using Texture2D = Raylib_CsLo.Texture;
global using TextureCubemap = Raylib_CsLo.Texture;
global using Matrix = System.Numerics.Matrix4x4;
```

The main limitation of the MPL being that: ***Modifications to the source code in this project must be open sourced***.  
The MPL is a great choice, both by providing flexibility to the user, and by encouraging contributions to the underlying project.

## Private Commercial License (**PCL**)
If for some reason you or your organization really, ***REALLY*** can not open source your modifications to this project, I am willing to offer a PCL for USD $1000, half of which will be donated to the upstream `raylib` project.  
Payment can be made via github donations.  
Yes $1000 is a lot of money, so just try to accept the MPL terms and move on with life!
